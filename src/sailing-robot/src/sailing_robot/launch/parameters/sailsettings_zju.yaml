# Sail position settings for sail sets 2 and 3 (medium & smaller sails)

# format: wind angle (as read from wind sensor), wind speed (m/s), scaled servo PWM
# scaled servo PWM: 0 = sail fully sheeted in, min PWM; 1 = sail fully out, max PWM
# linearly scaled inbetween
# CAUTION: include 0 angle and 180 angle, since those are the initial values in the lookup script
